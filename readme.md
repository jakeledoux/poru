# poru

poru is a simple polling website to demonstrate abilities in web development
using React. this project utilizes a number of new (to me) technologes, the most
important of which are:

## Frontend

- [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) for UI components
- [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) for API queries
- [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) for routing react (allowing page navigation)

## Backend

- [Apollo Server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server) for providing the GraphQL API
- [Kysely](https://github.com/koskimas/kysely) for handling database connections

and of course finally, React and TypeScript.

## Reflections

Adding features and managing state while using this stack is much cleaner and
far easier than with more "low-level" alternatives such as Python/Flask/Jinja.
